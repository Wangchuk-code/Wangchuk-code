## About Me :wave:
Hello! I’m Wangchuk, a Geospatial Analyst with over 6 years of experience, currently navigating through the icy and intriguing terrains of glaciers in Bhutan. With a deep interest in glacier dynamism and spatial data, I've been utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS) as a canvas to paint a vivid picture of moving glaciers and complex landscapes.
